    * CPPGDML: moved a few classes from G4Processer to G4Subscribers to fix static linking problem with granular libs
    * CPPGDML: fixed broken build of static examples; static application target now uses absolute paths to the static libraries
    * CPPGDML: added new switches for library configuration: 
               'enable-shared-lib' is replaced by 'enable-shared';
               'enable-static-lib' is replaced by 'enable-static';
               'enable-granular' will make examples link to package libs;
               'enable-single' will build a single GDML library and examples will link to it
               The default is shared + static + single.  Use all four switches to get the configuration you want.

        * config/autoconf: the build system has been extended by an Autoconf front-end;
	work done by Jeremy
	* G4Subscribers: a simple utility method has been added Util::generateName 
	which allows a non-trivial mapping of names (of volumes, solids, etc) used in GDML 
	( which must be unique ) to the names used in G4 objects. This is useful in case 
	of processing GDML files which where generated automatically (by GDMLWriter) and which 
	had hexadecimal addresses appended to the names in order to guarantee uniqueness.

	* GNUMakefile: all affected makefiles have been brought up tp date
	due to changes in libgdml.mk.
	* cygwin_local_setup.sh: The file has been populated by a sample
	setup of my local machine where I have all the software needed to
	build and run GDML processor and g4gogdml example. If someone
	wants to play on Cygwin with GDML I highly recommend to have a
	look at this file.
	NOTE: This file will likely change in the future as Cygwin
	platform is not well established in configuration management
	system of LCG.

	* G4VERSION: env. variable introduced and set to be default
	pointing to the last rh73_gcc32 GEANT4 release(6.1.ref01). The
	later releases will be or are already done by using the GCC 3.2.3
	compiler version.
